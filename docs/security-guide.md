## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DFO Smart Search application to protect data, users, and infrastructure.

## Authentication and Authorization

### AWS Cognito

- User authentication is handled through AWS Cognito
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Implements secure password policies
- Manages user sessions and tokens
- Handles user registration and sign-in flows

### IAM Roles and Policies

- Least privilege principle applied to all IAM roles
- Separate roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Regular audit of IAM permissions

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

- All resources deployed within a private VPC
- Network ACLs and Security Groups for traffic control
- RDS Proxy for database connection management
- Private subnets for sensitive resources

### API Gateway Security

- Regional API Gateway with private endpoints
- IAM authorization for API endpoints
- Request validation and throttling
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all API communications

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### WAF Configuration

The application is protected by AWS WAF with the following rules:

1. **Common Attack Protection** (Priority: 1)
   - Protects against common web exploits
   - Implements AWS managed rules for:
     - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
     - HTTP flooding
     - IP reputation
     - Bad bots
     - Size restrictions

2. **Rate Limiting** (Priority: 2)
   - Limits requests to 1000 per IP address
   - Helps prevent DDoS attacks
   - Configurable thresholds
   - IP-based rate limiting

### WAF Monitoring

- CloudWatch metrics for all WAF rules
- Sampled request logging
- Real-time monitoring of blocked requests
- Alert configuration for security events

## Data Security

### Encryption

- Data at rest encryption for all storage
- Data in transit encryption using TLS
- Key management through AWS KMS
- Regular key rotation

### Database Security

- RDS encryption enabled
- Network isolation through VPC
- Regular security patches
- Automated backups with encryption

### S3 Security

- Server-side encryption for all buckets
- Bucket policies for access control
- Versioning enabled
- Lifecycle policies for data management

## Monitoring and Logging

### CloudWatch

- Comprehensive logging of all services
- Metric monitoring and alerting
- Log retention policies
- Performance monitoring

### AWS Config

- Continuous monitoring of resource configurations
- Compliance checking
- Change tracking
- Security best practices enforcement

## Compliance and Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use AWS Cognito for secure user authentication
   - Implement proper role-based access control

3. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - Never store sensitive data in client-side code or localStorage
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for storing credentials and sensitive configuration

4. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use API keys and JWT tokens for authentication

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct regular security reviews of the codebase
   - Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Contact the AWS Security team immediately
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Document the incident and response actions
4. Implement remediation measures
5. Conduct a post-incident review
