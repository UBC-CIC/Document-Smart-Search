# DFO Smart Search Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DFO Smart Search application to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Features

### AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

The application is protected by AWS WAF, which helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

#### WAF Rules Implemented

1. **Rate Limiting Rule**
   - Limits requests to 100 per 5 minutes per IP address
   - Prevents brute force attacks and denial of service attempts

2. **AWS Managed Rules - Core Rule Set**
   - Provides protection against exploitation of a wide range of vulnerabilities
   - Includes protection against OWASP Top 10 security risks

3. **AWS Managed Rules - SQL Injection Rule Set**
   - Blocks request patterns associated with exploitation of SQL databases
   - Prevents attackers from modifying or extracting data from your database

4. **AWS Managed Rules - Known Bad Inputs Rule Set**
   - Blocks request patterns known to be invalid and associated with exploitation
   - Prevents common attack patterns and known malicious inputs

### AWS Shield Advanced

AWS Shield Advanced provides enhanced protections for your applications against more sophisticated and larger DDoS attacks.

#### Shield Features Enabled

1. **DDoS Protection**
   - Protects against layer 3/4 DDoS attacks (volumetric attacks)
   - Protects against layer 7 DDoS attacks (application layer attacks)

2. **24/7 DDoS Response Team (DRT)**
   - Access to AWS DDoS experts for assistance during attacks
   - Proactive engagement during large-scale events

3. **Real-time Visibility and Notifications**
   - Detailed metrics and reporting on DDoS events
   - Automated notifications when attacks are detected

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use AWS Cognito for secure user authentication
   - Implement proper role-based access control

3. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - Never store sensitive data in client-side code or localStorage
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for storing credentials and sensitive configuration

4. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use API keys and JWT tokens for authentication

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct regular security reviews of the codebase
   - Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Contact the AWS Security team immediately
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Document the incident and response actions
4. Implement remediation measures
5. Conduct a post-incident review
