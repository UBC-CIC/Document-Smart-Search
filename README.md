# DFO

This prototype explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance digital learning by providing an accessible and interactive way for the general public, educators, and administrators to engage with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). Acting as a conversational guide, the chatbot allows users to ask questions and receive tailored responses aligned with DFO principles and recommendations. This approach fosters a broader understanding of technology-enhanced learning, making digital literacy concepts and strategies more approachable and relevant across educational and public contexts.
